**Visual design principles**
=======================

Visual design elements and principles describe fundamental ideas about the practice of visual design (Wikipedia).
In this webpage, I am trying to apply a few design principles.  


**Principles of design**
-----------------------
- **Unity/harmony** - According to Alex White, author of The Elements of Graphic Design, to achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design. A good balance between unity and variety must be established to avoid a chaotic or a lifeless design.[10].(Wikipedia)  
*I am trying to work with this principle on this page by the choice of colors (simple black/white/gray palette for the elements and font with green accent color for the icon and links). I am using green here to alter the boring gray theme and keep the interest alive.
I think the repetition of these colors is giving the harmony/unity feeling.*  
- **Balance** - It is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.(Wikipedia)  
*Balance is also achieved through the use of the colors and symmetry between the elements as well as by the simple font.*   
- **Hierarchy** - A good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least important.(Wikipedia)  
- **Scale/proportion** - Using the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point. When elements are designed larger than life, scale is being used to show drama.[10].(Wikipedia)  
- **Dominance/emphasis** - Dominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape. The focal point should dominate the design with scale and contrast without sacrificing the unity of the whole.[10].(Wikipedia)  
*For the dominance/emphasis principle, I have added the 3d effect for the article text box to underline that there is the most important part and I am using bold headers in the main text. I have also added a movement effect on the navbar, that being one of the main parts of the page.*   
- **Similarity and contrast** - Planning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designer's work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity, important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.[10].(Wikipedia)  
*The similarity principle is also present here by the chosen color scheme, while for the contrast I have chosen to use a movement effect on the green icon which is in contrast with the otherwise very static and simple page ad well as a blur/unblur effect on the flash region picture.*
