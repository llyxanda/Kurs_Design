**Mobile operators in Sweden - webdesign elements & principles**
=======================

In this research I am analyzing 3 of the largest mobile telecommunication operators websites in Sweden in terms of design elements and principles used and how effective are these choices in transmitting the intended feelings or brand image for the three operators

**Urval**
-----------------------

I have chosen 3 of the largest mobile operators in Sweden as a sample for this research, the ones that I think represent most of that market and set the tone in this sector, so this should provide a reliable sample of websites.


**Metod**
-----------------------
For this analysis, I am looking at each website's choices of design elements and how they build upon design principles and trying to find similarities and differences between them, having in mind the brand image that these mobile operators have or are trying to convey.
As a definition for design elements, I am mainly using the Wikipedia page dedicated to this subject (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design_elements_and_principles)



**Resultat**
-----------------------

###**Telia.se**:

[FIGURE src="img/kmom06/telia-full.png" class="kmom04" caption="Telia.se"]

####Webiste's role
Telia.se is the website of one of the largest telecom services companies in Sweden and the Nordics. The website is meant to assist customers or/and convince visitors to become their customers by subscribing to their services. In this respect, the website needs to be in tune with the brand image.


####Website's look
The website is in tune with the brand logo which is purple, so that is the main design element that characterizes it (color).
They are using a simple monochromatic color scheme with purple color as the theme and black/gray/white tones for the background and font.

Everything is about the purple color and I think they are trying to transmit feelings of creativity, calmness, exclusiveness and perhaps daring - considering that  Telia is a premium mobile operator and in forefront of technology.
I think they manage well to express the brand image through the website's choices of design.

####Design principles used
As mentioned before, color is the main element used on the website through the use of a simple color scheme with a purple theme that is representative of the brand and the fellings it is trying to transmit. 
The purple color is used as a background color for the footer, as highlights for the links and also in elements found on the website like some of the pictures used, and the shapes of the buttons.

The main design principles used here are **balance and harmony** through the use of this color theme and the pictures that have colors and themes that convey these feelings. 
**Balance and harmony** because of the way the color purple is blended in the website together with the other colors and the color itself. 

**Harmony and unity** principles are also achieved with the rounded shapes used for the buttons.
Another principle that is achieved through the blend of colors (black fonts and icons with purple shapes and pictures) is **similarity and contrast**.
**Dominance/emphasis** is achieved through the use of space (middle os the screen), and pictures (big pictures as background for the message), and big fonts for the current offers that they would like to be the center of attention.

Almost all the pages on the website are in the same tone, most of them having a flash region with either a picture or just a purple background and they use the same principles for the whole website.


###**Telenor.se**:

####Webiste's role
Telenor.se is the website of one of the largest telecom services companies in Sweden and the Nordics. The website's role is to assist customers or/and convince visitors to become their customers by subscribing to their services. In this respect, the website needs to be in tune with the brand image.


####Website's look
The website is in tune with the brand logo which is blue, using a simple harmonic color palette with blue color as the theme/accent and light grays or blue and pale complementary tones as background.
I think the websites communicates feelings of calmness, simplicity, stability, and trust which is what the brand stands for, so they manage to do a good job is representing the brand through the website.


####Design principles used

The website has a light harmonic color palette with blue as a theme which gives a calm image.
The principles used on the website are:
- **Unity/harmony** - this is achieved with the blue color theme and pale tones and the repeating square shapes (text boxes) and pictures that are placed in zig-zag.
- **Balance** is also achieved through the colors used and the repeating shapes (rounded buttons) and text boxes together with pictures placed in a zig-zag pattern.
- **Emphasis and dominance** as a design principle is used even here and it is achieved through movement and placement on the page (REA textbox is animated), color and space (the main phone offers are placed in a bigger box with a gray background).
- **Similarity** principle is also used here through all the colors and shapes that are fitting together, while contrast is achieved through placing pictures and text boxes in the zig-zag pattern and through the animated text boxes and picture (movement on a calm setting).

The same design principles are used overall on the webpage, the only element that is present only on the front page is the animation.

###**Tele2.se**:

[FIGURE src="img/kmom06/tele2-full.png" class="kmom04" caption="Tele2.se"]

####Webiste's role
Tele.se is also a website that represents a large telecom operator in Sweden and the Nordics. The website role is the same as the other two websites analyzed, to assist customers or/and convince visitors to become their customers by subscribing to their services. In this respect, the website needs to be in tune with the brand image.


####Website's look
Tele2 is using a minimalistic light/dark color scheme with black color as the theme (as the brand logo) and light greys as background.
I think the design of the website is trying to transmit feelings of power, strength, and challenging/fearlessness which is what the brand stands for. In their design, they are using more pictures compared to the other websites analyzed, and it seems that they are trying to communicate more through them.


####Design principles used
The principles used on the website are:

- **Dominance/emphasis** is used here through elements like very big pictures with main messages (like current offers or services specifications) and in the same color theme (dark colors). 
- **Unity/harmony** - this is achieved with the repeating black color, the square text boxes and pictures used
- **Balance** is also achieved through the colors used and the repeating shapes (squared black buttons) and the symmetry of the square text boxes 
- **Similarity** is also achieved through all the colors and shapes that are correlating with each other while contrast is achieved by using the dark colors and pictures together with white font or vice-versa.

Here too, the same principles described above are used for almost all pages and subpages.

**Analys**
-----------------------

Considering that all the 3 websites represent competitor brands and they are all trying to offer the same services, it looks like they are using about the same design principles and are very similar I this respect.

All the 3 websites are using a somewhat simple color scheme and limited colors, with light backgrounds (mostly grays), trying to convey simplicity and easy-to-use feelings, which is appropriate for the mobile communication market. 

They are all applying the unity/harmony principle through the repetition of shapes and colors.

Balance is also achieved on all the websites through the symmetry of the elements (text boxes, pictures, and buttons) and colors.

Another principle that is present in all 3 websites is also dominance/emphasis and that is understandable considering all three websites are trying to attract new customers with current offers.
