**Visual design elements**
=======================

Visual design elements and principles describe fundamental ideas about the practice of visual design (Wikipedia).
On this webpage, I am trying to communicate that the subject is design so I am using a few design elements like picture, line, point, typography, texture and color.


**Elements of design** 
-----------------------

Design elements are the basic units of any visual design which form its structure and convey visual messages.[2][3] Painter and design theorist Maitland E. Graves (1902-1978), who attempted to gestate the fundamental principles of aesthetic order in visual design,[4] in his book, The Art of Color and Design (1941), defined the elements of design as line, direction, shape, size, texture, value, and color, concluding that "these elements are the materials from which all designs are built."[5] (Wikipedia )

- **Color** - Color is the result of light reflecting back from an object to our eyes.[6] The color that our eyes perceive is determined by the pigment of the object itself.[6] (Wikipedia)

*For this page I am using color for the font and a color from the same palette as in the flash picture (which I also chose based on the theme and colors) for the footer.*

- **Line** - Line is an element of art defined by a point moving in space. Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is horizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.(Wikipedia)

*In this page, I am using lines to delimit between the different sections in this article and as an effect when hovering over the navbar.*

- **Point** - A Point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. (Wikipedia)

*Here, I am using points just for showing the elements of the list.*

- **Shape** - A shape is defined as a two-dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.[14] Shapes are recognizable objects and forms[6] and are usually composed of other elements of design.[15] (Wikipedia)

*Here I am using a picture as a design element that is meant to communicate or represent the subject of the article in a relevant way.*

- **Texture/Pattern** - Texture refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface. (Wikipedia)

*I am using a shadow effect for the main article to draw attention to it.*

- **Space** - In design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. (Wikipedia)

*I am trying to use space around the design elements and text in a way that fits with the webpage*

- **Font Type** - Typography is also a design element and it has to do with the style and appearance of printed text in general. Font refers specifically to the font family used for the text.
*Here I have chosen a modern and simple font that I thought fits with the theme (design)*
