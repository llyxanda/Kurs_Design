**Web design trends in the insurance sector in Sweden**
=======================

In this research I am analysing what are the web design trends in the insurance sector in Sweden and trying to understand what is the intended look and feel of the websites representing these services.

**Urval**
-----------------------

As my research sample, I have chosen 4 of the largest insurance companies in Sweden:

1. [Skandia](https://www.skandia.se)
2. [Trygg-hansa](https://www.trygghansa.se)
3. [Folksam](https://www.folksam.se)
4. [Länsförsäkringar](https://www.lansforsakringar.se)


I have chosen these four companies because they are the largest ones and represent a big size of the market share in the sector, probably setting the trends in the sector and having bigger budgets to invest in their web design.

**Metod**
-----------------------
For this analysis, I am looking at design trends splitting this concept into a few dimensions:

1. Design elements used and their characteristics:
   - Color palette : backgrounds colors, font colors, accent colors, links colors
   - Typography : what are the fonts used, font weight 
   - Pictures : what do the pictures represent and what colors they use, how do they fit with the website
   - Shapes, form, icons, logos
   - Layout and space : where and how is the content placed and arranged
   - Special effects : movement, 3d effects (shadows, layers)  


2. Design principles - what are the design principles used and how do they contribute to the intended look, feel and scope of the website. 

3. Functionality
   - I have chosen to look at a few functional characteristics of the websites as well, namely, navigation (look and easy to use) and page speed performance. 


**Resultat**
-----------------------

### **Skandia**:

###Design elements used and their characteristics:
####Color palette used:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #ffffff">Background</td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #380354">Background</td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #D8D1CA">Background</td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #CFD2D7">Background</td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #009775">Accent color</td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #524B3D">Font color</td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #191919">Titles font color</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Website's color palette
Skandia.se is using a very limited color palette, with light backgrounds and the logo green-turquoise brand-logo color as accent, making it very in tune with the brand.  repeatedlyThe accent color in different tones is found repeatedly on the buttons, links, and even pictures and icons. This gives the website a feeling of simplicity and safety.  

#### Typography
The website is using sans-serif font, having 2 different types of fonts(an own font for the headings, and roboto for the paragraphs).  
They are also using a different colors for headings compared to the paragraphs belonging to the titles. 

#### Pictures
The pictures used are in tone with the color palette and the accent color (logo color) is always present in them in different tones, making them very well integrated on the overall look of the website.
They usually represent people in different circumstances, as one would expect considering the website represents a insurance company

#### Forms, shapes, icons
All of the buttons and text boxed are square shaped and the website has many icons, icons that are in the same accent color


#### Layout
The website has a horisontal navigation bar with two levels, a flash-picture region and the main content is arranged on 2/3 columns or on rows, depending on the subpage, in a rather inconsistent, sometimes, in an asymmetric way.
There is a lot of whitespace on the webpage, the information is centered and the different sections well delimitated.


#### Special effects : movement, 3d effects (shadows, layers)  
The website is using a layer effect for the text boxes containing the information, and there is no movement effect on the webpage.

### Design principles identified in the webpage
The website main design principle seems to be simplicity and tries to achieve a feeling of safety and trust which is in line with the services it is providing.
I have identified a few design principles present: 
1. Harmony/Unity - Harmony, unity is achieved through the use of the accent color repeating itself in the different elements in a variation of tomes (pictures, font, button, icons, logo) and also by the content and placements of the pictures.
2. Balance is achieved also through the use of the colors, the colors alternate and different tones of the same color are present.
3. Dominance/emphasis is present through the use of the flash picture (with people) region that is capturing the attention, the promoted message being placed inside this region, in a layers effect.

The design of the website is consistent throughout the subpages as well, with the same color palette, shapes, icons, similar pictures and layer effect. The only thing that differs on different subpages is the arrangement of the text boxes with information.

### Functionality

#### Page loading speed
Page insights score - mobile: 32
Page insights score - desktop: 72

Dev Tools Network tab - load time 1,49 sec
Dev Tools Network tab - size 1 MB
Resources: 69

The page gets a low mobile score and a moderate (high) score for the desktop on Google's PageSpeed Insights and the main recommendations to improve are to eliminate render-blocking resources (mostly css file that are probably not used) and use more modern picture formats.
However when browsing the page, the experience with it is good and loads quickly.

#### Navigation
The navbar has also a simple design and it is horisontal, on two lines (2 levels - Menu/submenu). When clicking an option the boxes background color changes to the accent color and a submenu appears with 2 columns: right column with a usual use case message for that section (ie. Vem vill du trygga?) which makes the user have quick access to the information needed on a different background color depending on the chosen section and on the left column, the menu choices. 
The use of the different colors for the right column of the submenu makes it differentiate better based on the topic, making it clearer, and gives a bit of variety from the main color scheme.


### **Trygg-Hansa**:

The website has large sections with very visual illustrations, icons or pictures, short messages (text) and large font, so that everything is very easy and fast to grasp in the main pages.

#### Special effects : movement, 3d effects (shadows, layers)  
The website is using a layer effect for the content text boxes , and there is no movement  on the webpage, except for a falling effect of the navbar when one scrolls up, which gives it a very nice touch.

### Design principles identified in the webpage
The website main design principle seems to be simplicity and tries to achieve a feeling of safety/trust but also a bit a feeling of being alive.
A few design principles that are identifiable on the webpage are: 
1. Harmony/Unity - Harmony, unity is achieved through the use of the different tones of blue color repeating itself in the different elements ( font, pictures, icons, logo) and also by the icons and illustrations which are very correlated with each-other by colors and design. The content and placements of the pictures and illustrations and the symmetrical arrangement of the content boxes and their consistency in size, elements and layout also contribute to the feelings of harmony and unity.
2. Balance is achieved also through the use of the colors, the combination of pale and calm tones with the more strident colors like pink, green and orange.
3. Dominance/emphasis is present through the use of the icons and large illustrations or pictures with large fonts.
4. Similarity/Contrast is also present through the use of the different colors (blue, pink, green, orange) and sometimes using an illustration or picture that has lighter colors with dark blue font next to one that has darker colors with white font.

The design of the website is consistent throughout the subpages as well, with the same color palette, shapes, illustrations and icons, similar pictures and layer effect. 

### Functionality

#### Page loading speed
Page insights score - mobile: 34
Page insights score - desktop: 90

Dev Tools Network tab - load time 1,5 sec
Dev Tools Network tab - size 1,2 MB
Resources: 85

The page gets a low mobile score and a high score for the desktop on Google's PageSpeed Insights and the main recommendations to improve are to eliminate render-blocking resources.
When browsing the page, the experience with it is good and the page loads quickly.

#### Navigation
The navbar has a simple design that is placed on a single line, with blue font on pale blue background, a minimalistic design. This gives a feeling of simplicity and easy to use.


**Analys**
-----------------------

The results show a few similarities between the websites analysed which can be interpreted as trends. 
All the websites have a quite simple and consistent design and the harmoni/unity principle is dominant especially in regard to the color palette used which is very aligned with the brand logo and brand image. This in itself transmits the intended feelings of easy to use, simple and safety/trust.
This seems to be the basis of the design for each of the websites and then each differentiate a bit from each-other through the elements used based on the services provided and the brand image that they want to have.
In terms of elements, the color palette used for all the websites is quite simple and in perfect alignment with the brand logo.The body background has light colors and there is an accent color.The content is arranged in rectangular boxes aligned and symmetrical that have a layer effect.
All 3 companies make use of pictures, in order to capture attention and transmit the intended messages and the pictures have colors that bled well with the palette of the website and mostly represent people, as one would expect with insurance companies.
The font used is sans-serif.
In terms of functionality all 3 websites perform quite well, the pages are loaded fast and the navigation bar and its content is very simple and clear - making up for a good experience for the user.

To summarise, the trends for web design in this sector seem to have to do with simplicity, easiness to use and safety/trust. This is achieved through:
- Simple light or pale color palettes for the backgrounds where the brand logo is very well integrated and corresponds with the brand image (color seems to be very important here), and an accent color.
- simple sans-serif fonts.
- Grid-layout arrangements with rectangular content boxes symmetrically aligned and with a layer effect.
- Use of pictures and illustrations to transmit the message, content or feelings intended in a very fast and visual way.
