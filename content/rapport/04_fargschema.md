Mobile operators in Sweden - webdesign choices
=======================

In this research I am analyzing 3 of the largest mobile telecommunication operators websites in Sweden in terms of design choices (colors and typography) and how effective are these choices in transmitting the intended feelings or brand image for the trhee operators

Urval
-----------------------

I have chosen 3 of the largest mobile operators in Sweden as a sample for this research, the ones that I think represent most of that market and set the tone in this sector, so this should provide a reliable sample of websites.

Metod
-----------------------
For this analysis, I am looking at each websites choice of colors palette and color scheme and typography and how they are used on the website and trying to find similarities and differences between them, having in mind the brand image that these mobile operators have or are trying to convey



Resultat

###Telia.se:

[FIGURE src="img/kmom04/telia_full.png" class="kmom04" caption="Telia.se"]

####Color pallete used:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: rgb(153, 9, 227)">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #222">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #380354">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #1f012f">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #f2f2f2">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #990ae3"> Accent color</td>
</tr>
</table>

####Font
Font used - default:  Helvetica Neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif

Font used H1: Pebble

####Notes
Telia is using a simple monochromatic color scheme with purple color as the theme and black/gray tones for the background and font.
The website is copying the brand logotype that is purple-colored and trying to transmit feelings of creativity, calmness, exclusiveness and perhaps daring - considering that  Telia is a premium mobile operator and in forefront of technology.
They are using a big background picture with the same color palette. I think they manage well to express the brand image through the website's choice of colors.


###Telenor:

####Color pallete used:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">

</tr>
</table>

####Font
Font used - default:  Roboto,arial,sans-serif;

####Notes
Telenor is using a minimalistic color scheme with blue color as the theme/accent and light grays as background. they also have a few pale complimentary tones for the background for accentuating a special offer (for the background).
The website is also in tone with the brand logotype that is blue colored and trying to transmit feelings of strength, trust and also stability which is what the brand stands for.

Analys
-----------------------

All the 3 websites are using a somewhat simple color scheme and limited colors, with light backgrounds (mostly grays), trying to convey simplicity and easy-to-use feelings, which is appropriate for the mobile communication market. 

All the websites have a color palette reflecting the brand logo color and the brand image.

All the websites are using simple, sans-serif fonts.

All the websites are using a slightly different font for H1
