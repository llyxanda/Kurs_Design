Kastro old town - Skiathos, Greece 
==================================
Skiathos Castle (Greek: Κάστρο της Σκιάθου) or simply Kastro is a medieval fortified site on the northern tip of the island of Skiathos in Greece, which was the main settlement of the island from the mid-14th century to 1829. It is now abandoned and a protected site.

I took this picture when I was traveling in Greece in may 2019 with my Iphone 8 camera.

>The castle is located on a rocky promontory on the northernmost point of the island. It is a naturally secure position, as it is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs overlooking the sea.
The population numbered between 500 and 1,500 people, living in tightly packed houses. There were 20 churches in four parishes, a chancellery, and several cisterns.
In the Ottoman period, a mosque and governor's residence were built for the small Turkish garrison. Following the castle's abandonment, only the two churches of St. Nicholas and of the Nativity—the cathedral of the local bishop—continued in use, while in recent years the churches of St. Marina and St. Basil, two cisterns, the Ottoman mosque, the gate complex, and parts of the walls have been restored.
