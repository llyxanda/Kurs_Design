Skiathos town, Greece 
==================================
Skiathos (Greek: Σκιάθος, Skiáthos) is a small Greek island in the northwest Aegean Sea. Skiathos is the westernmost island in the Northern Sporades group, east of the Pelion peninsula in Magnesia on the mainland, and west of the island of Skopelos.

>Skiathos Town, one of the most picturesque towns in the Greek islands, embraces the port and charms visitors with its picturesque atmosphere, the traditional whitewashed houses, the mansions with tiled roofs, the old churches, and narrow alleys. White is the dominant color and houses can be divided into noble properties and farmhouses which exist in total harmony to these days.
